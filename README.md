# Global-Terrorism-Data-Analysis
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the Global Terrorism Database. It explores various aspects of terrorism, including:

- Countries most affected by terrorism
- Most common weapon types used in different regions
- Trends and patterns in terrorism over the years

## Dataset
The data used in this project is the Global Terrorism Database, which is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world. Due to the large size of the dataset, it couldn't be hosted directly on GitHub.

### Obtaining the Data
To obtain the dataset, you can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd). Once downloaded, place the `PerpsAdded.csv` file in the same directory as the Jupyter notebooks before running them.

## Files
The repository contains the following files:

- PerpsAdded - Map.ipynb
- PerpsAdded - Terrorism by Country.ipynb
- PerpsAdded - Weapon Types and Terrorism.ipynb
- PerpsAdded - Terrorism Trends and Patterns.ipynb

## Analysis
The analysis is divided into three main sections:

- **Terrorism by Country:** This section explores the countries most affected by terrorism over the years. It includes a breakdown of the top 10 countries with the most terrorism events, as well as countries with reduced terrorism in recent times.

- **Weapon Types and Terrorism:** This section investigates the most common weapon types used in different regions and their impact on fatalities.

- **Terrorism Trends and Patterns:** This section examines the worst year for terrorism and the number of deaths per attack.

## Visualizations
The analysis includes various visualizations such as bar plots and line plots to better understand the data and the findings.

## Usage
To replicate this analysis, you will need Python along with the following libraries: pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. Also, ensure you've downloaded the dataset as mentioned in the Dataset section above.
